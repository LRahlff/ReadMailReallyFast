## compiling
 In order to compile rmrf you need to invoke
 <code>make all</code>
 This requires the following:
  * an POSIX compatible OS
  * an C++17 compatible compiler
  * libncurses-dev
  * libopenssl
  * boost (as long as you plan to run the tests)

 There is no <code>./configure</code> nor <code>make install</code> yet.
